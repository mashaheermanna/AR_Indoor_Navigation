# AR_Indoor_Navigation
a unity engine-based Indoor Navigation System.

the unity engine version that was used is 2022.3.0
this project used Unity's various inbuild libraries.

how it works ??
it uses the "bake" feature of unity, allowing us to map the movable surface area.
then that area is used to place our targets(called target cubes).
then we also make use of various other properties and components of that are necessary for the AR function.

additionally, we have used ZXing for scanning the QR codes.
